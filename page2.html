      <h1> Cars You Will Work With</h1>
      <h3> Toyota's</h3>
        <p> So one of the types of cars you will work with are toyota's. One of the reason for that is that a good majority of cars in America are Toyota's. Another reason is that they are very easy to maintain, handle, and modify. To add on toyota's are easier to inspect and repair which brings down price to fix and is better for both the cars owner and the engineer.

      <h3> Honda's</h3>
        <p> As the toyota, honda's are very similar to toyota's and carry the same traits as toyota. Ease of use, inexpensive, majority of people own, and easy to learn off of. the major difference of honda's are the engines and chasis, which makes it a little more difficult than toyota's. the reason for this is the honda engines have a unique transmission to engine that is both good and bad for engineers.
