    <h1>Auto Engineering</h1>
    <h3>What to Expect</h3>
    <p>The key to learning auto engineering would consist of many attributes that would need ccomplex thinking and creativity. For example if you were to change a hose to the radiator of your car you would have many ways in doing that including taking out the radiator or just going through the car and changing the hose from the inside. Also you would be surrounded by unexpected challenges that could be very complex and time consuming. Another thing to expect is the environment you will be introduced; it will be dirty, stressful, and confusing at first, but you will learn to adapt to it and love it. </p>
